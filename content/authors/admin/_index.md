I am an early-career scientist interested in computational hydrology. My undergraduate research background leverages data science to examine impacts of human activities on water quality. I am currently a MSc student in the Department of Geology at the University of Kansas where I am working with [Dr. Sam Zipper](https://www.samzipper.com/).
