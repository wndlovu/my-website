The moderndive R package consists of datasets and functions for tidyverse-friendly introductory linear regression. These tools leverage the well-developed tidyverse and broom packages to facilitate

Working with regression tables that include confidence intervals
Accessing regression outputs on an observation level (e.g. fitted/predicted values and residuals)
Inspecting scalar summaries of regression fit (e.g. R-squared, R-squared adjusted, and mean squared error)
Visualizing parallel slopes regression models using ggplot2-like syntax.
This R package is designed to supplement the book “Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse” available at ModernDive.com
